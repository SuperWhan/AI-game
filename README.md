# AI-game
# Method:
For this simple AI, it can accomplish some simple tasks. For my Gaming AI,
it is something that can play simple ball game. The main goal for the AI is
just collecting the falling ball with the movable bar.
The game is based on two objects, a ball and a bar. The player can control
the bar by using the keyboard to move left and right. This can be
showed on a user interface (see Figure 1), the white cube is which we call it ”ball”
and the little rectangle lays on the bottom is the ”bar”. The game is simple, we
need to control the bar to receive the ball, once the ball touch the ground, you
will loose the game, and the terminal will shows your score and terminate your
game with saying ”you loose the game”. Same to AI, if AI loose the game, there
will show loosing signal ”AI loose the game”. After several games, I will collect
the data from human’s performance and AI’s performance, with comparison,
we can have a conclusion which only on behalf of the game performance.
# Applied skills:
Programming design, project report, Algorithms, Python skills.
# Knowledge:
learned from how to modified a game to a automatic play game, learned how to
use pygame header. getting know with AI design by reading reasearch paper.
# Hardest part:
Prediction Accuracy, prediction ball relocate.
